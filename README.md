# HangMan-Game-Project

# This is the HangMan Game Project that took place during Semester 4.

# Hangman is a word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and represents it with underscores, 
# while the other player(s) guess letters one at a time. Correct guesses reveal the letters in the word, 
# while incorrect guesses result in drawing parts of a "hangman." The game continues until the word is guessed or 
# the hangman figure is completed, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed. It's a word puzzle game that 
# tests vocabulary and deduction skills.

# Tkinter is freely utilized in this project.

# Tkinter is a widely used Python library for the creation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
